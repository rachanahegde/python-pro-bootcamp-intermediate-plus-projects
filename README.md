<h1> Intermediate Plus Projects from the 100 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp </h1>
<h2> Day 32: Birthday Wisher Project </h2>
This project automates a "Happy Birthday" email to friends and family on their birthdays. Completed the project using what I've learned about email SMTP, datetime, pandas, working with csv files and reading text files. 

<h2> Day 33: ISS Overhead Notifier Project </h2>
Learning about APIs to build an ISS (International Space Station) tracker that emails me when the ISS is above my current location and it is night time.

<h2> Day 34: GUI Quiz App </h2>
This project involved building a class based Tkinter UI and reviewing OOP concepts to make a GUI quiz app. Questions for the Quizzler app were taken from the Open Trivia Database using the API. 

<h2> Day 35: Rain Alert App </h2>
Learned about API keys, authentication, environment variables and sending SMS using Python. Built an rain alert app that messages you in the morning, telling you to bring an umbrella if it's going to rain.

<h2> Day 36: Stock Trading News Alert Project </h2>
A Python program to help you trade stocks. It uses an API to get stock price data and calculates the percent increase/decrease in the value of the stock. If there's over 5% increase/decrease, the program will message us information about the fluctuation and send the first three recent news articles about the company (using an news API). I completed the hard level version of this project.

<h2> Day 37: Habit Tracker Project </h2>
Learned about advanced authentication and making POST/PUT/DELETE requests using the requests module. I used Pixela to build a habit tracker which displays the varying degrees of intensity to which I commmitted to the habit that day (i.e. coding for 30 mins).

<h2> Day 38: Exercise Tracking Application </h2>
Built a workout tracking application using google sheets and natural language processing (via Nutritionix API). This project helped review what I learned about APIs and making POST requests, authorization headers, and environment variables.

<h2> Day 39: Capstone Part 1: Flight Deal Finder & Day 40: Capstone Part 2: Flight Club</h2>

Part 1: This program finds flight deals for us to save $$ on our next trip. Google sheets tracks the locations we want to visit and the price cutoff (historical low price). We feed this location and price data into an flight search API which searches through all the locations, looking for the cheapest flight in the next 6 months. When it finds a flight deal, it sends the flight date and price via Twilio SMS module to our phone. Then, we can book it right away.

Part 2: This project turned into a product that let users sign up to use our service. We send users an email notifying them of the best flight deals.

<h2> Day 41-43: Web Foundation HTML/CSS </h2>
Building a personal CV website using HTML and CSS. 

<h2> Day 44: Web Foundation [Skipped Project] </h2>
I watched the lectures on intermediate CSS for Day 45 but opted out of the project since I'm already practicing my HTML/CSS skills through <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/rachanahegde">Frontend Mentor</a>.

<h2> Day 45: Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup </h2>
This project involved using beautiful soup for web scraping in order to compile a list of the 100 greatest movies to watch. 

<h2> Day 46: Create a Spotify Playlist using the Musical Time Machine </h2>
I used Python code to create a Spotify playlist of the top 100 songs that were playing on a particular date. To accomplish this, I used Beautiful Soup to scrape the Billboard Hot 100 songs from a certain date and the Spotify API to create a new playlist made up of those songs.

<h2> Day 47 </h2>
