<h1> Intermediate Plus Projects from the 100 Days of Code Python Pro Bootcamp </h1>
<h2> Day 32: Birthday Wisher Project </h2>
This project automates a "Happy Birthday" email to friends and family on their birthdays. Completed the project using what I've learned about email SMTP, datetime, pandas, working with csv files and reading text files. 

<h2> Day 33: ISS Overhead Notifier Project </h2>
Learning about APIs to build an ISS (International Space Station) tracker that emails me when the ISS is above my current location and it is night time.

<h2> Day 34: GUI Quiz App </h2>
This project involved building a class based Tkinter UI and reviewing OOP concepts to make a GUI quiz app. Questions for the Quizzler app were taken from the Open Trivia Database using the API. 

<h2> Day 35: Rain Alert App </h2>
Learned about API keys, authentication, environment variables and sending SMS using Python. Built an rain alert app that messages you in the morning, telling you to bring an umbrella if it's going to rain.

<h2> Day 36: Stock Trading News Alert Project </h2>
A Python program to help you trade stocks. It uses an API to get stock price data and calculates the percent increase/decrease in the value of the stock. If there's over 5% increase/decrease, the program will message us information about the fluctuation and send the first three recent news articles about the company.
